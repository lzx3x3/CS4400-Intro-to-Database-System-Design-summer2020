# CS4400-Intro-to-Database-System-Design-summer2020

This is the repository for final project in course Intro to Database System (gatech CS4400 summer 2020).

In this project, our team developed a relational database using MySQL for The Georgia PPE Management (GPM) application, which tracks transactions and inventory for Georgiaâ€™s hospitals and manufacturers to give all relevant parties the most up-to-date information on the availability of PPE.

There are 3 phases for this project. In phase I, we drew ERD diagram; in phase II tables and relations/constraints were created in MySQL and data were inserted; in phase III, will we implemented a list of stored procedures for the Georgia PPE Management System database.
